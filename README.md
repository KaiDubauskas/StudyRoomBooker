# StudyRoomBooker
## Description
A Web-based application to simulate reserving study rooms in different buildings at Vanderbilt University.

### The problem

During most of the school year, the supply of study rooms at Vanderbilt matches the supply. The one exception is during finals week, where open study rooms are far and few between. There was no way to see which study rooms in which buildings were open, and which were closed, forcing students to walk halfway around campus to find an open room to study in. This program was created to solve this problem, by allowing students to reserve and occupy study rooms. Others can then see which study rooms are open at which times, saving travel time. 

## How It Works

- Was built using MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, Node. 
- Backend serves was later deployed with MongoDb Realm to make the site serverless.
